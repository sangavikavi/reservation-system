 Here's a structured roadmap to implement the backend for BookingBistro:

### Milestone 1: Project Setup and User Management
1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize a Spring Boot project.
   - Configure Postgres as the database.
   - Set up required dependencies (Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, JWT, etc.).

2. **Database Design**
   - Design the ER diagram for the following tables:
     - Users (fields: id, full_name, email, password, phone_number, role)
     - Restaurants (fields: id, name, cuisines, location, working_days, working_hours, time_slot_interval, capacity)
     - Tables (fields: id, restaurant_id, table_type, number_of_tables)
     - Bookings (fields: id, user_id, restaurant_id, date, time_slot, number_of_guests, status)
   - Create database migration scripts using Flyway or Liquibase.

3. **User Management (Sign up & Log In)**
   - Implement sign-up API:
     - Validate input data.
     - Encrypt passwords using BCrypt.
     - Save user details to the database.
   - Implement login API:
     - Validate credentials.
     - Generate JWT token upon successful authentication.
     - Implement token-based authentication for securing endpoints.

4. **User Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement JWT token generation and validation.
   - Set up Spring Security to use JWT tokens for authentication.
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC).

5. **Unit Testing**
   - Write unit tests for user management and authentication APIs.

### Milestone 2: Restaurant Management
1. **Implement Register Restaurant Functionality**
   - Implement API for managers to register a restaurant.
   - Validate input data and save restaurant details to the database.

2. **Implement View All Available Restaurant API**
   - Implement API for customers to view all available restaurants.
   - Add pagination, sorting, and filtering.

3. **Unit Testing**
   - Write unit tests for restaurant registration and view APIs.

### Milestone 3: Booking Management
1. **Implement Get Restaurant Details Required for Booking**
   - Implement API to fetch working days, working hours, time slot intervals, and capacity of a restaurant.

2. **Implement Booking Table Functionality**
   - Implement API for customers to book a table.
   - Validate input data and ensure the selected time slot and number of guests are within the restaurant's capacity.

3. **Unit Testing**
   - Write unit tests for booking-related APIs.

### Milestone 4: Viewing and Managing Bookings
1. **Implement View All Bookings Functionality**
   - Implement API for customers to view their bookings.
   - Implement pagination, sorting, and filtering by status.

2. **Implement View All Reservation Requests Functionality**
   - Implement API for managers to view all reservation requests.
   - Implement pagination and filtering by status.

3. **Unit Testing**
   - Write unit tests for booking view and reservation request APIs.

### Milestone 5: Booking Cancellation and Approval
1. **Implement Cancel Booking Functionality**
   - Implement API for customers to cancel their bookings if they are in a pending state.

2. **Implement Reject/Confirm Reservation Request Functionality**
   - Implement API for managers to confirm or reject reservation requests.
   - Allocate tables based on the smallest table first approach.

3. **Unit Testing**
   - Write unit tests for booking cancellation and reservation request approval/rejection APIs.

4. **Swagger Integration**
   - Integrate Swagger for API documentation.
   - Ensure all APIs are documented and accessible via Swagger UI.

### Additional Notes
- **Logging and Error Handling**
  - Implement logging with appropriate levels.
  - Implement error handling at all layers.

- **Performance and Best Practices**
  - Optimize API performance.
  - Follow Java 8 functionalities, coding standards, and REST API guidelines.

- **Git and Testing**
  - Follow Git best practices.
  - Write both unit and integration test cases for all APIs.

By following this roadmap, you will systematically build and test the backend for BookingBistro, ensuring a robust and well-documented system.
